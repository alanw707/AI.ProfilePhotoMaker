# AI.ProfilePhotoMaker Project Plan

## Overview
This project plan outlines the major milestones, features, and tasks required to deliver the AI.ProfilePhotoMaker application, an AI-powered profile photo generator with a .NET 8 Web API backend and Angular frontend.

---

## Milestones & Timeline

1. **Project Setup & Core Infrastructure**
   - [x] Initialize .NET 8 Web API and Angular projects
   - [ ] Set up CI/CD pipelines
   - [x] Configure authentication (JWT)
   - [x] Set up database and migrations

2. **User Management & Authentication**
   - [x] Implement user registration and login endpoints
   - [ ] Add user profile management (CRUD)
   - [x] Enforce validation and error handling
   - [ ] Implement rate limiting for auth endpoints

3. **Profile Photo Styles & Selection**
   - [ ] Define available photo styles (DB or static)
   - [ ] Create endpoints to fetch and select styles (max 10 per user)
   - [ ] Integrate style selection in Angular UI

4. **Image Upload & Processing**
   - [ ] Implement image upload endpoint (max 10 selfies)
   - [ ] Validate and securely store images
   - [ ] Zip images for AI processing

5. **AI Service Integration (Replicate.com)**
   - [x] Integrate with Replicate.com API for model training
   - [x] Implement webhook endpoint for training completion
   - [x] Secure webhook with signature verification
   - [x] Trigger image generation for selected styles

6. **Generated Image Management**
   - [x] Store and present generated images to users (DB integration)
   - [ ] Implement download functionality
   - [ ] Enforce data retention (delete after 7 days)

7. **Payments & Transactions**
   - [ ] Integrate payment provider (e.g., Stripe)
   - [ ] Require payment before image generation/download
   - [ ] Track transactions per user

8. **Audit Logging & Activity Tracking**
   - [ ] Implement activity logging for key actions
   - [ ] Expose logs to admins (optional)

9. **Automated Cleanup & Data Retention**
   - [ ] Implement background jobs for image/model deletion
   - [ ] Test and document retention logic

10. **Frontend Development (Angular)**
    - [x] Build registration/login/profile pages (scaffolded)
    - [ ] Implement style selection and image upload UI
    - [ ] Display generated images and enable downloads
    - [ ] Integrate payment flow
    - [ ] Handle API errors and user feedback

11. **Testing & Quality Assurance**
    - [ ] Write unit/integration tests for backend
    - [ ] Write Angular component/service tests
    - [ ] Mock external APIs in tests
    - [ ] Achieve 80%+ code coverage

12. **Documentation & Deployment**
    - [x] Document API endpoints and error responses (Swagger)
    - [ ] Update README and user guides
    - [ ] Prepare for production deployment

## Key Risks & Mitigations
- **AI API changes or downtime:** Mock and test fallback flows
- **Data privacy:** Enforce strict retention and secure storage
- **Payment integration:** Use proven providers and test edge cases
- **User experience:** Gather feedback and iterate on UI/UX

---

## Success Criteria
- All major features implemented and tested
- Secure, scalable, and maintainable codebase
- Positive user feedback on generated images and workflow
- Compliance with privacy and data retention requirements
