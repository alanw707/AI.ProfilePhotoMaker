## âœ… Recently Completed Tasks

### Payment System Stabilization (2025-06-27)
**Status:** COMPLETED âœ…  
**Objective:** Eliminate Stripe console errors and create stable development environment

**Implementation Details:**
- **Backend Changes:**
  - Added `POST /api/credit/create-payment-intent` placeholder endpoint
  - Added `GET /api/credit/payment-config` configuration endpoint
  - Added `PaymentSimulation` configuration in appsettings.Development.json
  - Created `CreatePaymentIntentRequestDto` for API structure

- **Frontend Changes:**
  - Updated `StripeService` to conditionally load Stripe.js based on configuration
  - Enhanced `credit-packages.component.ts` with simulation support
  - Added development mode UI notices and simulation workflow
  - Implemented 2-second payment processing simulation

**Results:**
- âœ… Zero console errors from Stripe.js in development
- âœ… Complete payment workflow without real Stripe API calls
- âœ… Credits properly added to user accounts in simulation
- âœ… Easy toggle between simulation and real Stripe integration

### UI Code Deduplication (2025-06-27)
**Status:** COMPLETED âœ…  
**Objective:** Eliminate duplicate header navigation code across components

**Implementation Details:**
- Created shared `HeaderNavigationComponent` with unified logic
- Consolidated header HTML across 4+ components (dashboard, gallery, settings, premium, photo-enhancement)
- Unified TypeScript logic for theme toggle, logout, and user info
- Applied consistent styling and responsive behavior

**Results:**
- âœ… ~90% reduction in header-related code duplication
- âœ… Consistent navigation experience across all pages
- âœ… Easier maintenance and future updates
- âœ… Fixed navigation inconsistencies between pages

## ðŸ“‹ Planned Next Tasks

### Phase 1: Backend Architecture Refactoring
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Estimated Effort:** 2-3 weeks

**Objectives:**
1. **Controller Decomposition:**
   - Split `ProfileController` into focused controllers
   - Create `ImageController`, `TrainingController`, `GenerationController`
   - Maintain `ProfileController` for profile-only operations

2. **Service Layer Enhancement:**
   - Implement `IFileStorageService` (Local + Azure Blob Storage)
   - Create `IImageValidationService` for centralized validation
   - Develop `IWebhookProcessingService` for Replicate webhooks
   - Build `IPromptGenerationService` for AI prompt creation

3. **Configuration Management:**
   - Externalize all Replicate API configuration
   - Create strongly-typed settings classes
   - Implement configuration validation

### Phase 2: Data Layer Improvements
**Priority:** MEDIUM  
**Estimated Effort:** 1-2 weeks

**Objectives:**
1. **Database Schema Optimization:**
   - Configure explicit cascade delete relationships
   - Improve data integrity constraints
   - Optimize indexing for performance

2. **Data Seeding Enhancement:**
   - Move style definitions to external JSON
   - Implement flexible seeding strategy
   - Add data migration utilities

### Phase 3: Testing and Quality Assurance
**Priority:** MEDIUM  
**Estimated Effort:** 1-2 weeks

**Objectives:**
1. **Unit Testing:**
   - Service layer unit tests
   - Controller action tests
   - Model validation tests

2. **Integration Testing:**
   - API endpoint testing
   - Database operation testing
   - File upload/download testing

3. **End-to-End Testing:**
   - Complete user workflows
   - Payment simulation testing
   - Image processing pipelines

## ðŸ“Š Technical Debt Tracking

### High Priority Technical Debt
1. **ProfileController Size:** 900+ lines, needs decomposition
2. **Hardcoded Configuration:** Replicate API settings in code
3. **File Storage Coupling:** Tightly coupled to local filesystem
4. **Error Handling:** Inconsistent error response formats

### Medium Priority Technical Debt
1. **Code Duplication:** Some service logic duplication
2. **Logging Strategy:** Inconsistent logging across services
3. **Validation Logic:** Spread across controllers and models
4. **API Documentation:** Swagger documentation needs enhancement

### Low Priority Technical Debt
1. **CSS Bundle Size:** Frontend build warnings for large CSS
2. **Dependency Versions:** Some package updates available
3. **Code Comments:** Missing documentation in some areas

- `package.json` - Frontend dependencies and build scripts
- `.gitignore` - Excludes sensitive files and build artifacts

### Running the Application
```bash
# Backend API
cd AI.ProfilePhotoMaker.API
dotnet run

# Frontend UI  
cd AI.ProfilePhotoMaker.UI
ng serve

# Database Migrations
dotnet ef migrations add MigrationName
dotnet ef database update
```
